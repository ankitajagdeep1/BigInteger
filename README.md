Description
-----------

BigInteger represents integers, both positive and negative, as linked lists, with each node containing one digit of the integer. Each node with the digit points to the next one. Arithmetic operations are done on these integers.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The least significant digit is stored in the first node and the most significant digit is stored in the ending node. THerefore, the number 432 will be stored as 2 -> 3 -> 4

A boolean variable 'negative' is true if the integer in question is negative. This is because the negative sign will not be part of the linked list.

The function of the program is to take integers as user input, clean up any unnecessary spaces and symbols, store them as linked lists, and perform any desired operations

The main file that contains methods for the linked lists is BigInteger. The DigitNode file defines the class node. The BigTest creates an instance of BigInteger which can be used to test the functionality of the methods in BigInteger. These files are contained in the package 'bigint'.
